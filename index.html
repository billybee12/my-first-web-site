      <h2>Burn</h2>
      <p>
        A burn is an injury to skin, or other tissues, caused by heat, cold, electricity, chemicals, friction, or ultraviolet radiation (like sunburn).[5] Most burns are due to heat from hot liquids (called scalding), solids, or fire.[9] Burns occur mainly in the home or the workplace. In the home, risks are associated with domestic kitchens, including stoves, flames, and hot liquids.[6] In the workplace, risks are associated with fire and chemical and electric burns.[6] Alcoholism and smoking are other risk factors.[6] Burns can also occur as a result of self-harm or violence between people (assault).[6]

        Burns that affect only the superficial skin layers are known as superficial or first-degree burns.[2][10] They appear red without blisters and pain typically lasts around three days.[2][10] When the injury extends into some of the underlying skin layer, it is a partial-thickness or second-degree burn.[2] Blisters are frequently present and they are often very painful.[2] Healing can require up to eight weeks and scarring may occur.[2] In a full-thickness or third-degree burn, the injury extends to all layers of the skin.[2] Often there is no pain and the burnt area is stiff.[2] Healing typically does not occur on its own.[2] A fourth-degree burn additionally involves injury to deeper tissues, such as muscle, tendons, or bone.[2] The burn is often black and frequently leads to loss of the burned part.[2][11]
